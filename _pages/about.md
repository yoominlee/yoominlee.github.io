I’m a first-year M.S. student in Computer Science (AI) at the University of Southern California. I work in computer vision and applied machine learning, with a focus on measurable quality/robustness and reliable, reproducible deployment. I’m especially interested in evaluation under distribution shift, data curation, and the engineering that turns promising models into dependable products.

Previously, I was a research member in the **AIoT Group at Seoul National University**, and an undergraduate researcher in the **Multimodal AI Lab at Hanyang University**; earlier, I interned at **COGA Robotics**. My projects have spanned sensor–model co-design for robust recognition, dataset design and protocol building, and hardening ML pipelines for real-world use.

I received a B.S. in **Computer Science & Interior Architecture Design** from Hanyang University. The design training sharpened my spatial reasoning and user-centered thinking, which I apply to building clear, reproducible ML baselines and fast demos.
If you’d like to discuss practical ML or vision systems, feel free to reach out by email.






<!-- I’m **Yoomin Lee**, an MS in Computer Science who enjoys the unglamorous—but critical—work of turning promising models into **reliable, reproducible products**. My work sits across **applied ML, IR/NLP**, and **systems for ML**: building and evaluating RAG/search pipelines, instrumenting latency–quality trade-offs, and insisting on clear metrics, ablations, and regression-safe rollouts. I prefer simple designs that scale, disciplined experiment tracking, and baselines you can re-run without surprises. Lately I’ve been developing a domain-specific retrieval system with tight offline/online evaluation parity and strengthening an ML pipeline with explicit feature definitions, drift monitoring, and CI for metrics. I’m comfortable across Python, PyTorch/sklearn, FAISS/Elasticsearch, and MLflow/W&B—with Docker and GitHub Actions to keep the edges clean. If you care about measurable progress in applied ML, let’s talk. -->















<!-- I’m **Yoomin Lee**, an **MS in Computer Science** student who cares about turning ideas into **measurable, reproducible systems**. My work sits at the intersection of **applied ML**, **information retrieval/NLP**, and **systems for ML**—the unglamorous but critical path from a promising model to a reliable product.

**What I work on**
- Building and evaluating **RAG / search** pipelines (hybrid retrieval, reranking, latency–quality trade-offs)
- **Applied ML** from data prep to deployment (clear metrics, ablations, and regression-safe rollouts)
- **MLOps & experimentation** (versioned datasets, tracked runs, reproducible baselines)
- Fast, usable **demos** to shorten feedback loops

**Principles**
- Ship small, measure honestly, document decisions.
- Prefer simplicity that scales over complexity that dazzles.
- Reproduce first; optimize second.

**Recently**
- Prototyping a domain-specific retrieval system with offline/online eval parity  
- Hardening an ML pipeline (feature definitions, drift checks, CI for metrics)

**Background**
- CS foundation with strong hands-on engineering: Python, PyTorch/sklearn, FAISS/Elasticsearch, Pandas/Polars  
- Tooling: MLflow / W&B, Docker, GitHub Actions, Jekyll/JS for simple product surfaces

<!-- 
Hi! I’m **Yoomin Lee**, an **MS in Computer Science** student focused on turning data and models into real product impact. I enjoy closing the gap between research and engineering—designing systems that are measurable, reproducible, and ship-ready.

**Focus areas**
- **Applied ML & AI**: modeling, evaluation, optimization, deployment (MLOps)
- **Information Retrieval / NLP**: embedding & hybrid search, reranking, QA
- **Systems for ML**: performance tuning, pipelines, and experiment reproducibility
- **Fast demos**: usable frontends for quick feedback loops

**What I’m working on**
- *[One-line project]* e.g., “RAG pipeline for domain-specific search: better retrieval + lower latency/cost”
- *[Course/Lab/Collab]* e.g., “Feature store + offline/online evaluation for user behavior prediction”

> See **[Projects](/projects/)** and **[Blog](/blog/)** for details and write-ups.

**Tech**
- **Python** (PyTorch, scikit-learn), **IR** (FAISS/Elasticsearch)
- **MLOps** (W&B / MLflow / DVC), **Data** (Pandas/Polars)
- **Dev** (Jekyll, JS, Docker, GitHub Actions)

I like to **ship quickly → test hypotheses → tune for cost & performance**, with strong documentation and reproducibility.

**Goals**
- Build ML systems that deliver value to real users, combining **papers + production**
- Collaborate with labs/industry on clear, data-driven problem statements

_Open to research collaborations, internships, and roles where success criteria are defined and measurable._
